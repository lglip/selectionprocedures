# The top-ranked selection procedures to hire the best-performing job candidate
The contents of this repository are related to a [LinkedIn article]() in which I visualised and commented on the results from [Sackett et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000994). This study revisits the meta-analytic operational validity estimates of key selection procedures used in personnel selection.

Logically, the raw data can be retrieved from the `data` folder and are taken directly from Sackett et al. (2021). PDF versions of two key references in the LinkedIn article can be found in the the `references` folder. Graphs are in the `img` folder.
